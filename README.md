ðŸ“‹ Interaction Form Validation

ðŸ§© Project Overview

The Interaction Form Validation project is a simple yet essential web-based application designed to validate user input in real-time during form submission. The main objective of this project is to ensure that all user-entered data meets the specified criteria before submission. It enhances user experience, prevents invalid data entry, and maintains data integrity in web applications.

This project demonstrates how front-end validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can make forms interactive, responsive, and error-free.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

To validate user input fields like name, email, phone number, and password.

To provide instant feedback to users using visual indicators and messages.

To prevent submission of incomplete or incorrect data.

To improve form usability and accessibility.

To implement both client-side validation and basic error handling.

âš™ Technologies Used

HTML5 â€“ for structuring the form layout.

CSS3 â€“ for styling and responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6) â€“ for validation logic and interactive functionality.


---

ðŸ§  Features

Real-time validation for all input fields.

Error messages for incorrect or missing input.

Success indicators for valid entries.

Validation for:

Name (non-empty and alphabetic).

Email (correct email format).

Phone number (numeric and length check).

Password (minimum length, special character check).


Submit button activates only when all validations pass.

Responsive UI suitable for both desktop and mobile.

ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. User fills out the form fields.


2. JavaScript functions check each field based on predefined rules.


3. If any field fails validation, an error message is displayed below that field.


4. Once all inputs are valid, the form allows submission and displays a success message.

ðŸ§ª Example Validation Rules

function validateEmail(email) {
  const regex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,4}$/;
  return regex.test(email);
}
